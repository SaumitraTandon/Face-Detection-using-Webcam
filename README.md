# Real-Time Face Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that uses the OpenCV library to detect faces in real-time video captured from a webcam or a connected camera.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Download the Haar cascade classifier file `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` and place it in the repository directory.

## Usage

1. Connect a webcam or a camera to your computer.

2. Run the script:
The script will open a window displaying the real-time video feed from the connected camera. Detected faces will be highlighted with green rectangles.

To exit the script, press the 'q' key.

## File Structure

- `camera.py`: The Python script for real-time face detection.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: The pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection.
- `README.md`: This file.
